## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game, an interactive web application designed to provide a delightful and engaging gaming experience to users looking for an online strategy game that incorporates elements of luck and decision-making.

## The Five Planes of UX

### Strategy Plane

The core objective of this application is to entertain users with a strategy-based game that is both familiar and novel.

### Scope Plane

I established the requirements to include game modes with varying difficulty (RPS and RPSLS), a limited number of tries (single and best of 3), real-time score tracking, and a scoreboard for user sessions. Content-wise, I focused on clear instructions, engaging feedback, and session-based progress tracking.

### Structure Plane

In this plane, I designed the interaction between the user and the application. It includes starting a new game, making selections, receiving instant feedback, and reviewing scores. Information architecture was  planned to ensure intuitive navigation and a logical flow of actions.

### Skeleton Plane

The interface, navigation, and information design were crafted to provide a seamless user experience. This involved creating a consistent layout, ensuring clear pathways for navigating through the game, and presenting game rules and scores in an understandable format. Figma was used to wireframe.

### Surface Plane

In the final plane, I brought visual aesthetics to the forefront. The design features a color scheme and AI generated images, playful graphics, and animations that complement the game's strategy theme. Responsive design principles ensure the application is usable across a variety of devices. The colour palette was chosen to be Muted grey, blue and white (# 809a9f # 012536 # fffcf1).



## Purpose

The primary purpose of this web application is to entertain users by providing a digital version of the classic game with added complexity through the inclusion of Lizard and Spock options. This is inspired by the Big Bang Theoryâ€™s version of the game. It aims to challenge players by offering different levels of difficulty and play modes.

## Value Proposition

This game stands out by providing a familiar yet different gaming experience that is accessible to all users, regardless of device. It enhances cognitive skills by requiring players to remember and apply the expanded rules of this classic game.

## Target Audience

The game is targeted towards individuals who enjoy casual games and are looking for quick and entertaining play sessions. It's perfect for players of all ages seeking a fun challenge against a computer opponent.

## Key Features
